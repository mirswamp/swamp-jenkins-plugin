== Introduction:
This plugin allows you to submit SWAMP assessments during Jenkins builds.
The SWAMP assessment will use open source static analysis tools to test your source code for vulnerabilities and flaws.
For more information on the SWAMP, visit https://continuousassurance.org
For more information on Jenkins, visit https://jenkins.io/

== Prerequisites:
The usage of this plugin requires the following:

- A functional instance of Jenkins. +
  If you do not have a Jenkins installation, go to https://jenkins.io to get
  Jenkins. +
  A good tutorial for how to set it up is at
  http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jenkins/.
- A valid SWAMP account. +
  We suggest that you create an Application Password for use with Jenkins. +
  If you do not have an account, go to https://continuousassurance.org to register.

=== Jenkins plugin with Swamp-In-The-Box (SiB) instances


If you are using an SiB instance that uses a _self-signed_ SSL/TLS certificate then, the SWAMP Jenkins plugin will fail to communicate with that SiB instance. The reason being Java's security model by default does not allow communicating with a web-service that has a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate. To overcome this restriction, the web-service's self-signed SSL/TLS certificate has to be added to the Java installation's _default keystore_ on the machine that is running the Jenkins server. The following are the instructions on how to do it:

. Access the SiB from the web-browser and download the SiB's self-signed certificate by following these instruction here:
https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/how-to-view-ssl-certificate-details-in-chrome-56/

. Run the following commands to add the self-signed certificate to the Java installation's keystore:
--
a. Change the present working directory to your Java installation directory + `jre/lib/security/`.
+
.................
   cd $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security
.................
+
b. Make a backup copy of the `cacerts` file
+
.................
   cp cacerts cacerts.original
.................
+
c. Add the certificate to the keystore (Assuming here that the self-signed certificate is stored on the desktop as _www.sib-swamp.org.cer_)
+
.................
   sudo keytool -importcert -alias sib-name -file ~/Desktop/www.sib-swamp.org.cer -keystore $PWD/cacerts
.................
--


== Configure the SWAMP Jenkins Plugin
The SWAMP Jenkins Plugin must be configured before use. Starting version `1.1.3`, SWAMP plugin uses https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin[Credentials API].
This configuration is modified on the following web interface:

. Go to your Jenkins URL in a web browser
. Click _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Configure System_
. Scroll to the SWAMP Configuration Section (near the bottom of the
  configuration page), and enter the following:

[width="80%",cols="1,3",options="header"]
|==========================
|Parameter | Description
|Swamp URL a| URL of SWAMP web site.
The default is the SWAMP public instance at https://www.mir-swamp.org.
If you are using SWAMP-in-a-Box, contact your administrator for the URL to use.
2+|*Credentials*
|Swamp Credentials| Select the SWAMP credentials from the drop-down list.

If SWAMP credentials are not in the list, _Add Credentials_ by clicking on *Add* button and choosing *Jenkins (Jenkins Credentials Provider)*.

In the *Add Credentials* page:

1. Choose a *Domain* to store SWAMP credentials. This is _optional_, default is _Global Credentials (unrestricted)_. Users can create a _domain_ to group credentials by going to _Jenkins_ -> _Credentials_ and selecting _Add Domain_ in the _Jenkins_ drop-down list.

2. For *Kind*, Select _Username with password_ from the drop-down list.

3. For *Scope*, choose *Global*.

4. Enter SWAMP username and password in the *Username* and *Password* text boxes.

3. In the *Description* textbox, enter _SWAMP_ or any string that lets you distinguish _SWAMP_ credentials.

4. Leave the *ID* text-box empty.

5. Save the credentials by clicking on the *Add* button.

NOTE: If you use _third party credential_ such as _github_ to log into SWAMP then, create and use a SWAMP https://www.mir-swamp.org/#my-account/passwords[Application Password].

|Test Connection Button | Use this button to validate the credentials and URL that you have entered
2+|*Global Project Settings*
|Default Project | The default project to be used for each upload
Can be modified in build settings
2+|*Miscellaneous Options*
|Verbose Mode | Provide extra output for status updates and error checking
|==========================

== Use the SWAMP Jenkins Plugin
. Go to your Jenkins URL in a web browser
. Click on the project link that you want to assess with the SWAMP
. Click on the _Configure_ link for the project on the left side
. Scroll to the *Post Build Actions* section (or click the _Post Build Actions_ tab)
. Click the _Add Post Build Action_ button and select "*Swamp Assessment*"
. In the SWAMP Assessment section, fill out the data as follows:

[width="80%",cols="1,3",options="header"]
|==========================
|Parameter | Description
2+|*Package Settings*
|Package Directory | If the main directory of your package is located in a subdirectory, enter it here.
|Package Name | Enter the name of your package here.  This is the name that will be used in the SWAMP UI.
|Package Version a| Enter the version string of your package.
Every build should have a unique version String. The following macros may be used

[horizontal]
$build:: unique Jenkins build id
$date:: current date
$git:: most recent git commit id
$svn:: most recent svn commit id

If you do not update the version number each build (either using any of the above options or manually updating the version) then submissions will have the same version and be difficult to distinguish in the user interface.
|Package Language | The language that your package uses.
2+|*Build Settings*
|Build System | Select the build system your project uses.
|Build Directory | Enter a value if your software needs to build in different directory than
the _Package Directory_.  The directory is relative this the _Package Directory_
|Build File |Leave blank if using a standard build file name for the select _Build System_
(i.e. _build.xml_ for Ant, _pom.xml_ for Maven, _Makefile_ for Make)
Enter a path to the file if the build file is using a non standard name. The path is relative to the _Build Directory_.
|Build Target |If building your package requires a special build target, enter it here, otherwise leave blank
|Build Command |If your package uses a build command other than a standard type specified by the build system enter it here. Otherwise leave blank and the command will be determined by the _Build System_. (Syntax is Bash)
|Build Options |If your package requires options to passed to the build command, enter it
here (e.g. `--verbose --setInt 1`), otherwise leave blank.
Add multiple options separated by spaces as usual.
|Configuration Command |If your package requires a configuration command, enter it here. If left blank, the configuration will be called without a command. (Syntax is Bash)
|Configuration Options |If your package requires configuration options, enter them here similarly to the build options.
|Clean Command a|Enter the command to clean your build.
Leave blank to use the `[build-system] clean`
2+|*Assessment Settings*
|Project Name |The name of the project to use in the SWAMP.
2+|*Click _Add_ to configure the Tool and Platforms to use:*
|Tool |Select the tool you would like to use for this assessment.
|Platform |Select the platform you would like to use for this assessment.
2+|*Output Settings*
|Assessment Output Directory |Places the output of the assessments from the SWAMP in this directory from the workspace.

|==========================

== Running an Assessment
When you run a build through any method (i.e. build button, git hook, etc.), the SWAMP Jenkins Plugin will send the package to the SWAMP for assessment.
To view the status of your build, go to _your project_ -> _build *_ (listed on the left hand side, pick the most recent build) -> _console output_

== Viewing your Results

Results from the assessments are viewable in Jenkins on completion.
These results will be viewable in the source code, and will also be parsed into a graph.
This graph is configurable by clicking the _configure_ link beneath the graph.

Otherwise, the SWAMP web site can be used to view results of your assessments:

. Login to the SWAMP as normal.
. Click _Results_
. Click the checkbox next to the assessment results you would like to review
. Click _View Assessment Results_ button

== Accessing SWAMP via a HTTP Proxy:

SWAMP plugin uses the http proxy settings specified on the standard jenkins interface `https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JenkinsBehindProxy`.
Incase if you do not want the SWAMP plugin to use the http proxy, specify the SWAMP URL in the *No Proxy Host* section in the proxy settings.
